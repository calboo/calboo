ðŸ‘‹ Greetings and hello! I am Callum Boocock, and this is my personal github page. 

ðŸ‘€ I use this space for both my personal ML projects and for the codes that I used during my Astrophysics PhD at QMUL.  
:notebook: I have left links to my papers in the descriptions where relevant.  

ðŸ“« If you would like to chat or use these codes for your own work, you can reach me at calboo@hotmail.co.uk
